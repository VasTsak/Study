    "The Problem with Single Link Clustering is that it can lead to prolonged clusters (while we would like more compact) and sometimes when we want two clusters we end up one cluster eating up almost the whole data set. \n",

    "Dendograms can be quite useful. The final result of the clustering may not be as good, but if we look at the dendograms, we may identify the clusters. \n",

    "Complete link is similar to the single link clustering but the only difference is when you want to add a new point to the cluster you don't take the distance of the closest point of the cluster to the candidate point but the farthest point of the cluster.  \n",
