    "The fourth step is to evaluate the log-likelihood. And the log-likelihood sums for all clusters here.  Basically, what this says is that the higher this number is, the more sure we are that the mixer model that we've generated is responsible for creating the data or fits the dataset that we have. And so, the purpose here is to maximize this value, this term. We do that by choosing the parameters of the Gaussians, including the mixing coefficient, the mean, and the variance of each Gaussian. The better parameters we pick, the higher the value of this entire term will be. And then we do that until the algorithm converges, until it reaches a maximum or it starts to increase by a tiny fraction each step. And so, that's where we can stop the algorithm.\n",
