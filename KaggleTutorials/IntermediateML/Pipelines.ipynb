    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use pipelines to clean up your modeling code.\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cleaner Code: Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n",
    "* Fewer Bugs: There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "* Easier to Productionize: It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "* More Options for Model Validation: You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n"
