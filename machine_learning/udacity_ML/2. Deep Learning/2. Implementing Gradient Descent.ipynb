    "## Log-Loss vs Mean Squared Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section,we saw the log-loss function. There are many other error functions used for neural networks. Let me teach you another one, called the **mean squared error**. As the name says, this one is the mean of the squares of the differences between the predictions and the labels. In the following section I'll go over it in detail, then we'll get to implement backpropagation with it on the same student admissions dataset.\n",

    "## Gradient Descent with Squared Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the weights for our neural networks. Let's start by thinking about the goal. The network needs to make predictions as close as possible to the real values. To measure this, **we use a metric of how wrong the predictions are, the error**. A common metric is the **sum of the squared errors (SSE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mu} \\sum_j \\left[ y^{\\mu}_j - \\hat{y} ^{\\mu}_j \\right]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{y}$ is the prediction and $y$ is the true value, and you take the sum over all output units $j$ and another sum over all data points $\\mu$. This might seem like a really complicated equation at first, but it's fairly simple once you understand the symbols and can say what's going on in words.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the inside sum over $j$. This variable $j$ represents the output units of the network. So this inside sum is saying for each output unit, find the difference between the true value $y$ and the predicted value from the network $\\hat y$, then square the difference, then sum up all those squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the other sum over $\\mu$ is a sum over all the data points. So, for each data point you calculate the inner sum of the squared differences for each output unit. Then you sum up those squared differences for each data point. That gives you the overall error for all the output predictions for all the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SSE is a good choice for a few reasons. \n",
    "1. The square ensures the error is **always positive** and **larger errors are penalized more** than smaller errors. \n",
    "2. Also, it makes the math nice, always a plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the output of a neural network, the prediction, depends on the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}^{\\mu}_j = f \\left( \\sum_i{ w_{ij} x^{\\mu}_i }\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and accordingly the error depends on the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mu} \\sum_j \\left[ y^{\\mu}_j - f \\left( \\sum_i{ w_{ij} x^{\\mu}_i }\\right) \\right]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the network's prediction error to be as small as possible and the weights are the knobs we can use to make that happen. Our goal is to find weights $w_{ij}$ that minimize the squared error $E$. To do this with a neural network, typically you'd use **gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With gradient descent, we take multiple small steps towards our goal. In this case, **we want to change the weights in steps that reduce the error**. Continuing the analogy, the error is our mountain and we want to get to the bottom. Since the fastest way down a mountain is in the **steepest direction**, the steps taken should be in the direction that minimizes the error the most. We can find this direction by calculating the **gradient of the squared error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gradient* is another term for **rate of change or slope**. If you need to brush up on this concept, check out [Khan Academy's](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/gradient-and-directional-derivatives/v/gradient) great lectures on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a rate of change, we turn to calculus, specifically derivatives. A derivative of a function $f(x)$ gives you another function $f'(x)$ that returns the slope of $f(x)$ at point $x$. For example, consider $f(x)=x^2$. The derivative of $x^2$ is $f'(x) = 2x$. So, at $x = 2$, the slope is $f'(2) = 4$. Plotting this out, it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![derivative-example.png](pics/derivative-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **gradient** is just a **derivative generalized to functions with more than one variable**. We can use calculus to find the gradient at any point in our error function, which depends on the input weights. You'll see how the gradient descent step is derived on the next page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I've plotted an example of the error of a neural network with two inputs, and accordingly, two weights. You can read this like a topographical map where points on a contour line have the same error and darker contour lines correspond to larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, you calculate the error and the gradient, then use those to determine how much to change each weight. Repeating this process will eventually find weights that are close to the minimum of the error function, the black dot in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "![gradient-descent.png](pics/gradient-descent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "Since the weights will just go wherever the gradient takes them, they can end up where the error is low, but not the lowest. These spots are called local minima. If the weights are initialized with the wrong values, gradient descent could lead the weights into a local minimum, illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![local-minima.png](pics/local-minima.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "You've seen how to implement that for a single update, but how do we translate that code to calculate many weight updates so our network will learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, I'm going to have you use gradient descent to train a network on graduate school admissions data (found at http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv). This dataset has three input features: GRE score, GPA, and the rank of the undergraduate school (numbered 1 through 4). Institutions with rank 1 have the highest prestige, those with rank 4 have the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "![admissions-data.png](pics/admissions-data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to predict if a student will be admitted to a graduate program based on these features. For this, we'll use a network with one output layer with one unit. We'll use a sigmoid function for the output unit activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think there will be three input units, but we actually need to transform the data first. The rank feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode rank, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train. Instead, if we standardize the data, we can initialize the weights easily and everyone is happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![example-data.png](pics/example-data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the data is ready, we see that there are six input features: gre, gpa, and the four rank dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Square Error\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to make a small change to how we calculate the error here. Instead of the **SSE**, we're going to use the mean of the square errors (**MSE**). Now that we're using a lot of data, summing up all the weight steps can lead to really large updates that make the gradient descent diverge. To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, $m$ to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001. Then, we can use the MSE (shown below) to calculate the gradient and the result is the same as before, just averaged instead of summed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mse.png](pics/mse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general algorithm for updating the weights with gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set the weight step to zero: $\\Delta w_i = 0$\n",
    "* For each record in the training data:\n",
    "    * Make a forward pass through the network, calculating the output $\\hat y = f(\\sum_i w_i x_i) $\n",
    "    * Calculate the error term for the output unit, $\\delta = (y - \\hat y) * f'(\\sum_i w_i x_i)$\n",
    "    * Update the weight step $\\Delta w_i = \\Delta w_i + \\delta x_i$\n",
    "* Update the weights $w_i = w_i + \\eta \\Delta w_i / m$ where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $m$ is the number of records. Here we're averaging the weight steps to help reduce any large variations in the training data.\n",
    "* Repeat for $e$ epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also update the weights on each record instead of averaging the weight steps after going through all the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we're using the sigmoid for the activation function, $f(h) = 1/(1+e^{-h})$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the gradient of the sigmoid is $f'(h) = f(h) (1 - f(h))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is the input to the output unit,\n",
    "\n",
    "$h = \\sum_i w_i x_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing with NumPy\n",
    "For the most part, this is pretty straightforward with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to initialize the weights. We want these to be small such that the input to the sigmoid is in the linear region near 0 and not squashed at the high and low ends. It's also important to initialize them randomly so that they all have different starting values and diverge, breaking symmetry. So, we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is $1/\\sqrt{n}$ where $n$ is the number of input units. This keeps the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.\n",
    "\n",
    "`weights = np.random.normal(scale=1/n_features**.5, size=n_features)`\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a function `np.dot()` that calculates the dot product of two arrays, which conveniently calculates $h$ for us. The dot product multiplies two arrays element-wise, the first element in array 1 is multiplied by the first element in array 2, and so on. Then, each product is summed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`output_in = np.dot(weights, inputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, we can update $\\Delta w_i$ $w_i$ by incrementing them with `weights += ...` which is shorthand for `weights = weights + ....`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency tip!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save some calculations since we're using a sigmoid here. For the sigmoid function, $f'(h) = f(h) (1 - f(h))$. That means that once you calculate $f(h)$, the activation of the output unit, you can use it to calculate the gradient for the error gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming exercise\n",
    "Below, you'll implement gradient descent and train the network on the admissions data. Your goal here is to train the network until you reach a minimum in the mean square error (MSE) on the training set. You need to implement:\n",

    "Before, we were dealing with only one output node which made the code straightforward. However now that we have multiple input units and multiple hidden units, the weights between them will require two indices: $w_{ij}$ where $i$ denotes input units and $j$ are the hidden units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following image shows our network, with its input units labeled $x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$, and its hidden nodes labeled $h_1$ and $h_2$:\n",

    "The lines indicating the weights leading to $h_1$ have been colored differently from those leading to $h_2$ just to make it easier to read.\n",

Suppose there are two input values, one hidden unit, and one output unit, with sigmoid activations on the hidden and output units. The following image depicts this network. (Note: the input values are shown as nodes at the bottom of the image, while the network's output value is shown as $\\hat y$ at the top. The inputs themselves do not count as a layer, which is why this is considered a two layer network.)\n",

    "\n",
    "With the network output, we can start the backwards pass to calculate the weight updates for both layers. Using the fact that for the sigmoid function $f'(W \\cdot a) = f(W \\cdot a) (1 - f(W \\cdot a))$, the error term for the output unit is\n",

    "Now we need to calculate the error term for the hidden unit with backpropagation. Here we'll scale the error term from the output unit by the weight $W$ connecting it to the hidden unit. For the hidden unit error term, $\\delta^h_j = \\sum_k W_{jk} \\delta^o_k f'(h_j)$, but since we have one hidden unit and one output unit, this is much simpler.\n",

    "From this example, you can see one of the effects of using the sigmoid function for the activations. The maximum derivative of the sigmoid function is $0.25$, so the errors in the output layer get reduced by at least $75%$, and errors in the hidden layer are scaled down by at least $93.75%$! You can see that if you have a lot of layers, using a sigmoid activation function will quickly reduce the weight steps to tiny values in layers near the input. This is known as the **vanishing gradient** problem. Later in the course you'll learn about other activation functions that perform better in this regard and are more commonly used in modern network architectures.\n",
