    "![rm_1](pics/rm_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, MSE is a little bit easier to work with, so everybody uses MSE instead of RMSE. But there is a little bit of difference between the two for gradient-based models. Take a look at the gradient of RMSE with respect to i-th prediction. It is basically equal to gradient of MSE multiplied by some value. The value doesn't depend on the index I. It means that travelling along MSE gradient is equivalent to traveling along RMSE gradient but with a different flowing rate and the flowing rate depends on MSE score itself. So, it is kind of dynamic. So even though RMSE and MSE are really similar in terms of models scoring, they can be not immediately interchangeable for gradient based methods. We will probably need to adjust some parameters like the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, it's hard to realize if our model is good or not by looking at the absolute values of MSE or RMSE. It really depends on the properties of the dataset and their target vector. How much variation is there in the target vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We would probably want to measure how much our model is better than the constant baseline.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![rm_1](pics/rm_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " When MSE of our predictions is zero, the R_squared is 1, and when our MSE is equal to MSE over constant model, then R_squared is zero. Well, because the values in numerator and denominator are the same. And all reasonable models will score between 0 and 1. The most important thing for us is that to optimize R_squared, we can optimize MSE. It will be absolutely equivalent since R_squared is basically MSE score divided by a constant and subtracted from another constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rm_1](pics/rm_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important about this metric is that it penalizes huge errors that not as that badly as MSE does. Thus, it's not that sensitive to outliers as mean square error. It also has a little bit different applications than MSE. MAE is widely used in finance, where $\\$$10 error is usually exactly two times worse than $\\$$5 error. On the other hand, MSE metric thinks that $\\$$10 error is four times worse than $\\$$5 error. MAE is easier to justify. And if you used RMSE, it would become really hard to explain to your boss how you evaluated your model. What constant is optimal for MAE? It's quite easy to find that its a median of the target values\n",
    "\n",
    "![rm_1](pics/rm_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing about MAE is its gradients with respect to the predictions. The grid end is a step function and it takes -1 when Y_hat is smaller than the target and +1 when it is larger. Now, the gradient is not defined when the prediction is perfect, because when Y_hat is equal to Y, we can not evaluate gradient. It is not defined. So formally, MAE is not differentiable, but in fact, how often your predictions perfectly measure the target. \n",

    "But note the asymmetry of the error curves. From the perspective of RMSLE, it is always better to predict more than the same amount less than target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as root mean square error doesn't differ much from mean square error, RMSLE can be calculated without root operation. But the rooted version is more widely used. It is important to know that the plot we see here on the slide is built for a version without the root. And for a root version, an analogous plot would be misleading.\n",

MSPE and MAPE are biased towards smaller targets because they assign higher weight to the object with small targets. And RMSLE is frequently considered as better metrics than MAPE, since it is less biased towards small targets, yet works with relative errors. I strongly encourage you to think about the baseline for metrics that you can face for first time."

    "The problem is, that the base line accuracy can be very high for a data set, even 99%, and that makes it hard to interpret the results. Although accuracy score is very clean and intuitive, it turns out to be quite hard to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy also doesn't care how confident the classifier is in the predictions, and what soft predictions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, people sometimes prefer to use different metrics that are first, easier to optimize. And second, these metrics work with soft predictions, not hard ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_1.png](pics/cm_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, it should be mentioned that to avoid in practice, predictions are clipped to be not from 0 to 1, but from some small positive number to 1 minus some small positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_1.png](pics/cm_3.png)\n",
    "As we can see it prefers to do many small mistakes than a big one. \n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_1.png](pics/cm_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that to compute accuracy score for a binary task, we usually take soft predictions from our model and apply threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC metric kind of tries all possible thresholds and aggregates those scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_1.png](pics/cm_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, there are several ways AUC, or this area under curve, can be explained. \n",
    "1. The first one explains under what curve we should compute area. \n",
    "2. And the second explains AUC as the probability of object pairs to be correctly ordered by our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Explanation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually it's very simple to calculate Receiver Operating Curve (ROC), we start from bottom left corner and go up every time we see red point. And right when we see a green one. Let's see. So we stand on the leftmost point first. And it is red, or positive. So we increase the number of true positives and move up. Next, we jump on the green point. It is false positive, and so we go right. Then two times up for two red points. And finally two times right for the last green point. We finished in the top right corner. And it always works like that. We start from bottom left and end up in top right corner when we jump on the right most point. \n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_1.png](pics/cm_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we are ready to calculate an area under this curve. The area is seven and we need to normalize it by the total plural area of the square. So AUC is 7/9\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't need a threshold to be specified and it doesn't depend on absolute values. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Explanation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider all pairs of objects, such that one object is from red class and another one is from green. AUC is a probability that score for the green one will be higher than the score for the red one. In other words, AUC is a fraction of correctly ordered pairs. You see in our example we have two incorrectly ordered pairs and nine pairs in total.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that if we always predict the label of the most frequent class, we can already get pretty high accuracy score, and that can be misleading. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Cohen's Kappa we take another value as the baseline. We take the higher predictions for the data set and shuffle them, like randomly permute. And then we calculate an accuracy for these shuffled predictions. And that will be our baseline. Well to be precise, we permute and calculate accuracies many times and take, as the baseline, an average for those computed accuracies. \n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_9.png](pics/cm_10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " We need, first, to multiply the empirical frequencies of our predictions and grant those labels for each class, and then sum them up. For example, if we assign 20 cat labels and 80 dog labels at random, then the baseline accuracy will be 0.2*0.1 + 0.8*0.9 = 0.74.\n",
    " \n",
    "We can also recall that error is equal to 1 minus accuracy. We could rewrite the formula as 1 minus model's error/baseline error.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_9.png](pics/cm_11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain weighted Kappa, we first need to do a step aside, and introduce weighted error. See now we have cats, dogs and tigers to classify. And we are more or less okay if we predict dog instead of cat. But it's undesirable to predict cat or dog if it's really a tiger. So we're going to form a weight matrix where each cell contains The weight for the mistake we might do.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to calculate weight and error we need another matrix, confusion matrix, for the classifier's prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix shows how our classifier distributes the predictions over the objects. For example, the first column indicates that four cats out of ten were recognized correctly, two were classified as dogs and four as tigers. So to get a weighted error score, we need to multiply these two matrices element-wise and sum their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cm_14.png](pics/cm_14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the weight matrices are defined in a very simple way. For example, for classification problems with ordered labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you need to assign each object a value from 1 to 3. It can be, for instance, a rating of how severe the disease is. And it is not regression, since you do not allow to output values to be somewhere between the ratings and the ground truth values also look more like labels, not as numeric values to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "So such problems are usually treated as classification problems, but weight matrix is introduced to account for order of the labels.\n"

You set a model to optimize any loss function it can optimize and you monitor the desired metric on a validation set. And you stop the training when the model starts to fit according to the desired metric and not according to the metric the model is truly optimizing. That is important. Of course, some metrics cannot be even easily evaluated. For example, if the metric is based on a human assessor's opinions, you cannot evaluate it on every iteration. For such metrics, we cannot use early stopping, but we will never find such metrics in a competition. \n",

For multi-class tasks, fit any metric and tune parameters comparing the models by their accuracy score, not by the metric that the models were really optimizing.\n",
