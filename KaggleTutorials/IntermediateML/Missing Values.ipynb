    "In this tutorial, you will learn three approaches to dealing with missing values. Then you'll compare the effectiveness of these approaches on a real-world dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways data can end up with missing values. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A 2 bedroom house won't include a value for the size of a third bedroom.\n",
    "2. A survey respondent may choose not to share his income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. So you'll need to choose one of the strategies below.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Three Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) A Simple Option: Drop Columns with Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest option is to drop columns with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![drop_cols](drop_cols.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) A Better Option: Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "![imputation](imputation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) An Extension To ImputationÂ¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "![extension_of_imputation](extension_of_imputation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we will work with the Melbourne Housing dataset. Our model will use information such as the number of rooms and land size to predict home price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.\n"

However, we see that dropping columns performs slightly better! While this can probably partially be attributed to noise in the dataset, another potential explanation is that the imputation method is not a great match to this dataset. That is, maybe instead of filling in the mean value, it makes more sense to set every missing value to a value of 0, to fill in the most frequently encountered value, or to use some other method. For instance, consider the GarageYrBlt column (which indicates the year that the garage was built). It's likely that in some cases, a missing value could indicate a house that does not have a garage. Does it make more sense to fill in the median value along each column in this case? Or could we get better results by filling in the minimum value along each column? It's not quite clear what's best in this case, but perhaps we can rule out some options immediately - for instance, setting missing values in this column to 0 is likely to yield horrible results!\n",
