For example, we can compute correlation between the counts. It's the most common type of matrices people build, correlation metric. But we can compute other things than correlation. For example, how many times one feature is larger than the other? I mean, how many rows are there such that the value of the first feature is larger than the value of the second one? \n",

If the data was shuffled properly we would expect some kind of oscillation of the target values around the mean target value. But in this case, it looks like the end of the train set is much different to the start, and we have some patterns.\n",
